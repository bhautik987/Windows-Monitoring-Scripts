The Monitis WMI Monitor can monitor virtually any application. 
The current version is configured to monitor for Microsoft IIS 7.0, SQL 2005 and 2008 R2, Exchange, SharePoint servers, Terminal Services and Bandwidth health status by measuring  the popular metrics via WMI classes attributes.

Please note that you should have administrative privilages to be able to run the WMI Monitor because most of WMI activities (including all of those carried out on remote computers) require administrator rights. If you typically log on using a regular user account instead of an administrator account, you will not be able to perform most WMI tasks unless you run the script under alternate credentials. 
Besides, you should have enough privilages to work with Windows PowerShell and BasicScript.

If all the above is clear for you, lets go next.
