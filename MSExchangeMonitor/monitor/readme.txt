The current version is configured to monitor service's state by using WMI classes of Microsoft Exchange server.

Please note that you should have administrative privilages to be able to run the WMI Monitor because most of WMI activities (including all of those carried out on remote computers) require administrator rights. If you typically log on using a regular user account instead of an administrator account, you will not be able to perform most WMI tasks unless you run the script under alternate credentials. 
Besides, you should have enough privilages to work with Windows PowerShell and BasicScript.

If all the above is clear for you, lets go next.
