##ï»¿The Monitis Monitor for MS Exchange Server Services 

The project presents the implementation of Monitis Custom Monitor that has aim to evaluate health state  
of MS Exchange Services by using Windows WMI possibility.  
It is implemented by using PowerShell and BasicScript and use Monitis Java SDK that wraps the Monitis Open API functionality.  
This is one possible way to create a WMI monitor that can monitor any Exchange Services that supports the CIM standard.  

The Repository contains the following  

          start.bat                Main executable script
          monitis_logo-jpg.bmp
          Monitis_logo.ico
          login.ps1                Wizard - Monitis account credentials checker
          metrics.ps1              Wizard - select metrics for monitoring
          propwin.ps1              Wizard - requests a specific data for monitor and monitored object
          readme.ps1               Wizard - show Monitor info 
          scheduler.ps1            Wizard - schedules monitor by creating the Windows scheduler task 
          user.ps1                 Wizard - requests a user credentials for Windows
          CreateCustMonitor.vbs    adds custom monitor into Monitis and push results
          TestData.vbs             checks for accessibility of the monitoring object and metrics availability
          metrics.xml              the main configuration file
          Readme.md                This Readme file
          setup.exe                WMI Monitor installator


#### Dependencies

To execute WMI scripts on a remote system, the appropriate permissions for the namespaces on that system are required.  
This means that you need to have the administrative credentials for the system on which you want to perform WMI operations.  
Otherwise you will not be able to execute any WMI operations.  
Besides, the monitor uses Windows Powershell. Thus, you have to have installed Powershell in old versions of Windows.  
Note that the Powershell is already integrated in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2.  

#### Installation

To do monitor usage more convenient, the setup process was added. So, you can run it and follow Wizard.  

#### Preparing Monitor

The Wizard that prepares your desired configuration and creates WMI monitor can be launched by calling start.bat  
or simply by clicking on WMI Monitor desktop icon (created during setup).  

#### The WMI monitor measures the following metrics

The current monitor contains the set of metrics that were preliminarily chosen from lot of existing  
and more or less suitable for evaluation the health state of monitored objects (__absent, running, stopped__).  
Naturally, you can select/deselect any metrics from this set during monitor  
To do monitor usage more convenient, the setup process was added. So, you can run it and follow Wizard.setup.

#### Monitor usage

If you want to test current monitor, you have to have firstly the account in the Monitis,  
next you should start Wizard by click on desktop icon.  

#### Customizing by adding a new services for MS Exchange Server Services monitoring

You can simply add new service into the MS Exchange Server Services monitor for monitoring.  
To do so, you should add a new section into XML configuration that describe your metrics.
